# Co-Designing Pulmonary Rehabilitation Resources for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) benefits people with COPD, yet individuals with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) often need more personalised support and structured follow-up.  
This project adapts and co-designs practical tools to help clinicians and patients tailor PR using a Treatable Traits framework. It builds on a multi-method programme at the University of Birmingham (systematic review, cohort analysis, qualitative work, and a three-round Delphi with patients and HCPs).
